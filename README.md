üìä Plant Co. Power BI Sales Performance Report
‚ùì Problem
In many organizations, sales performance reporting is static, fragmented across time periods, and lacks comparative insight. Managers often struggle to quickly assess how current sales figures relate to past performance (e.g., year-over-year) or forecast end-of-year outcomes based on current trends. Additionally, decision-makers need flexible reports that adapt based on the KPI they want to focus on (e.g., sales vs. profit), without building separate dashboards for each.

üí° Solution
This Power BI report was built to address those issues using a clean and dynamic dashboard for Plant Co., a fictional company. It leverages advanced DAX techniques to create a versatile and reusable performance tracking tool, featuring:

‚úÖ Dynamic KPI selection: One slicer lets users toggle between Sales, Quantity, and Gross Profit.

‚úÖ YTD / PYTD metrics: Key metrics are calculated year-to-date and compared to the same period of the prior year.

‚úÖ Run rate projection: Based on current performance, the report estimates end-of-year totals.

‚úÖ Smart dynamic titles: The report title automatically reflects user selections (metric + year) to improve context and readability.

‚úÖ Clean data model: Includes a proper calendar table and follows best practices in modeling and measure creation.

All metrics are computed using DAX to ensure accuracy and flexibility, and the visual layout is designed to be intuitive for non-technical users.

üìà Result
The final dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of:

Current year performance (YTD),

Prior year comparison (PYTD),

Estimated full-year projection (Run Rate),

A clear focus on the selected KPI and time frame.

This project showcases strong data modeling, DAX proficiency, and dashboard design, making it ideal for inclusion in a data analyst portfolio or as a technical reference for Power BI learning.
